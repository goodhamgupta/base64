# Base64

A library to encode and decode binaries using the base64 encoding scheme. Implemented based on Nikalas Long's [blog](https://simplabs.com/blog/2020/06/25/writing-rust-nifs-for-elixir-with-rustler/) and [repository](https://github.com/niklaslong/base64/).


## Installation

You need to install Rust. Instructions are available [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `base64` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:base64, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
